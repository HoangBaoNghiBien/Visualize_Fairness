This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
#### 1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

#### 2. Install Python packages (if you haven't installed them yet):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. To run the project:

First, you have to run the server (backend) by running the following command:

```bash
npm run backend
```

If it displays the message below in the terminal, the server is running successfully:

```bash
Server is running on port 3000
```

Second, open another terminal for the frontend and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now, you can open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
